# About Me

My name is Bart, a 23-year-old web design development enthusiast from CMD at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. I have a strong passion for web development and I'm constantly learning and exploring new concepts in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Creating websites and web applications is not just a hobby for me, but a true passion. I'm excited to continue honing my skills and contributing to the ever-evolving world of web development.
